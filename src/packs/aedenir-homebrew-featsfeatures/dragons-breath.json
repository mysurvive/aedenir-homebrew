      "value": "<p>You can unleash a powerful blast of energy as a draconic breath weapon. Choose either a @Template[type:line|distance:30] or a @Template[type:cone|distance:15]. Your breath weapon manifests in the chosen shape and once chosen, you can't change the breath's shape. Your breath weapon deals @Damage[ceil(@actor.level/2)d4[@actor.flags.pf2e.drakkgebor.draconicProgenitor.damageType]]{1d4 leveled damage} based on the damage type of your @UUID[Compendium.aedenir-homebrew.aed-featsfeatures.Item.BuCMLaYYCfM0L600]. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You canâ€™t use this ability again for [[/r 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4. The damage of your breath attack is determined by your @UUID[Compendium.aedenir-homebrew.aed-featsfeatures.Item.BuCMLaYYCfM0L600]{Draconic Progenitor}. If your draconic progenitor has a breath weapon, your breath weapon deals the same type of damage as your progenitor's. If your draconic progenitor doesn't have a breath weapon, but does have a trait related to an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), your breath weapon's damage is that type. If your draconic progenitor doesn't have a breath weapon or associated energy type, your breath is a blast of powerful air that buffets foes and deals bludgeoning damage. Your breath weapon requires a @Check[type:reflex|basic:true|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)]{basic Reflex saving throw}, unless it deals poison damage. In that case, it requires a @Check[type:fortitude|basic:true|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)]{basic Fortitude saving throw} instead.</p>"
