It could be a creature or symbol beloved by your clan, or a purely internal source or filter of your rage, such as a belief, curse, heritage, or state of mind. Each instinct grants an instinct ability, plus more abilities you can gain via feats that list that instinct as a prerequisite. It also determines what damage you resist with raging resistance and, at higher levels, increases the additional damage you deal when you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.WZUCvxqbigXos1L9]{Rage}.</p>\n<p>Each instinct lists acts that are anathema to it. Whenever you perform such acts, you lose the instinct's abilities and any feats that list your instinct as a prerequisite until you spend 1 day of downtime re-centering yourself, though you keep all of your other barbarian abilities.</p>"
