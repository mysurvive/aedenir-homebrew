The GM will make you aware that a creature succeeded on their check. You may choose to use Keldaine's protection to force a reroll of the dice to take the lower of the two options. If you do so, their check gains the misfortune trait, and the outcome of this new roll is a secret to you.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you fail an impersonation check against a creature, you are aware of your blunder. The GM will make you aware that you have failed the check, and you may choose to use Keldaine's protection to force a reroll to take the higher of the two options. If you do so, the check gains the fortune trait, and the outcome of this new roll is a secret to you.</p>"
