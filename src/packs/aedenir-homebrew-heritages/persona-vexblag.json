You gain the Different Worlds feat. In addition, when you approach a new community you may already be aware of local Vexbalg personas that you can use. At the GM's discretion, make a @Check[dc:15|type:flat|traits:action:impersonate,secret]. If you succeed, you may interact with this settlement as if you had a second identity from the Different Worlds feat, but without the benefit of the lore skill. You could have already established a persona as a priest who will receive sustenance at the local temple, a folk hero who will be sheltered by the common people, or a veteran soldier who can always get a bed at the local garrison. Once this check has been made against a settlement, you may not make it again for another month.</p>"
