For many naturalists, the trees are seen as sentient beings who have withstood the ages, unflinching and always watching with a wealth of knowledge waiting to be unlocked. Every ship built from timber, every house built of lumber has a story that stretches far beyond what they have seen since their creation - they hold the stories of bloodied battles between wolf and doe and the rustling of a hundred thousand leaves in their boughs. Followers of Old Gnarlroot find themselves often in quiet contemplation and introspection, much like the trees.</div>\n<div class=\"additional\">\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Edicts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Responsibly use wood to improve both your life and the lives of others</li>\n<li>Spend time reflecting on your actions</li>\n<li>Give back what you have taken, as mutual exchange</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Anathema</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deforestation for sake of destruction</li>\n<li>Ignoring one's own actions</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Areas of Concern</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Trees in the forest</li>\n<li>Introspection on one's deeds</li>\n<li>Duty and hard work</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/122755/characters/1263953\">LINK</a></div>"
