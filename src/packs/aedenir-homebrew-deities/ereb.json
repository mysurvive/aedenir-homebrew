He was born to rule over and control arcane magic and proliferate the expansion of the mind and higher intelligence. Ereb enjoys watching his followers continue to gain knowledge and expand their magical and mental capabilities beyond their current limits. Though not much is known about the personality of Ereb, many of his followers claim that he takes an intellectual stance on all matters, believing that no action is inherently good or evil, but rather that every action has its purpose. As such, they also believe that he is relatively cold and calculating, though these are the perceptions of mortals who cannot comprehend the machinations of the divine.</div>\n<div class=\"additional\">\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Edicts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Gather and record information</li>\n<li>Continue learning</li>\n<li>Be one step ahead of everyone else</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Anathema</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Idiocy</li>\n<li>Censorship</li>\n<li>Forgetting knowledge</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Areas of Concern</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Arcane Magic</li>\n<li>Knowledge</li>\n<li>Investigation</li>\n<li>Planning</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/122755/characters/758377\">https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/122755/characters/758377</a></div>"
