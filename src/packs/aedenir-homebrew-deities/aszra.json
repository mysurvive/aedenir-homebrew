With the eradication of dragons early in the age of recollection, Aszra's power and breadth of reach was significantly diminished, though there are still followers across Aedenir. When not concerning itself with the proliferation of dragonkind, Aszra's domain focuses on the convergence of fate and luck, both being seen as parts of a greater whole. The scripture of Asza states that fate will guide you to a destination, but luck will determine your outcome. There are tales that there were once great hordes of wealth stashed all over Aedenir, given as offerings to Aszra in order to attempt to buy the wyrm's favor, and bend luck in their direction. </div>\n<div class=\"additional\">\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Edicts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay proper reverence to wyrmkin</li>\n<li>Follow the convergence of fate and luck, each influence one another</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Anathema</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hunting Wyrmkin for sport</li>\n<li>Ignoring fate or fortune</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Areas of Concern</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Wyrmkin</li>\n<li>The convergence of luck and fate</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/122755/characters/958369\">LINK</a></div>"
