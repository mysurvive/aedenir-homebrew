While Tergrid represents a significant degree of physical fortitude, they also espouse teachings of mental fortitude, particularly to hold firm to your beliefs. Bending to the will of others who are antithetical to your beliefs, and questioning your beliefs based on what others say is blasphemous to Tergrid. That being said, there is an understanding that new information begets new beliefs - however, this change must come from within, not forced upon a person from external forces. Making concessions for others that directly contradicts your own beliefs is also considered blasphemous - there are no concessions to be made in the realm of wills.</div>\n<div class=\"additional\">\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Edicts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stand firm in your beliefs</li>\n<li>Remain grounded even in the face of extreme adversity</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Anathema</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Airheadedness</li>\n<li>Disregarding the earth</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Areas of Concern</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The ground and that which comes skittering from it</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/122755/characters/958585\">LINK</a></div>"
