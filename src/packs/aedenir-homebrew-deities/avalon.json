The edicts of Avalon state that one must not become complacent and let their soul be tied to the ground. This is often seen as a metaphorical edict rather than a physical decree - it is not considered antithetical to settle down and live in a place, but allowing your soul, spiritually, to take root in a place is bad practice. It is also considered blasphemous to allow others to partake in slavery or imprisonment - it is seen as an attempt to force the spirit into a state of stagnancy.</div>\n<div class=\"additional\">\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Edicts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Let not your soul be tied to the ground</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Anathema</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Slavery</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note\">\n<h3>Areas of Concern</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Weather</li>\n<li>Air</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/122755/characters/958582\">LINK</a></div>"
